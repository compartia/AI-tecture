# AI-tecture

## Abstract
The goal is to create an artificial intelligence system capable of developing highly optimised master plans.

## Motivation
### The problem
The problems we see in modern cities:

- People spend a lot of time on the road. Traffic jams, gasoline costs, transportation and service costs. This is pretty obvious.

- The second, the less obvious problem is that people live in isolation from each other: they spend time either in private individual houses, or in high-rise buildings on the outskirts, or in transport. 

Off-line communication is not effective anymore.

This entails a loss of the synergy effect. For the system to be effective, the agents should be enabled to observe each other and copy successful models and strategies.

- A great latency in feedback loop - the time from creating a master plan to evaluating it in reality can be enormous.

- We're observing chaotic urban sprawl for decades, but we donâ€™t know still what are the effective ways of land use and conservation.
